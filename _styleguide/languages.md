## Python
Python code should conform to [Pep-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

Many IDEs provide automatic linting of code to identify violations of PEP-8.

An excellent, extensive, guide to writing good Python code can be found at
[The Hitchhikers Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/)

## MATLAB
A good style guide for Matlab, used by RR engineers, is available on the 
[Mathworks file exchange](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46056-matlab-style-guidelines-2-0).

A quick-reference version of this style guide can be found 
[here](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/e5a683fc-4a80-11e4-9553-005056977bd0/f8c4e908-a5b6-4ffb-a36a-9ee47990dfd3/images/screenshot.png)

## FORTRAN
The guide recommended by RR is the 
[European Standards for Writing and Documenting Exchangeable Fortran 90 Code](https://wiki.c2sm.ethz.ch/pub/COSMO/CosmoRules/europ_sd.pdf).

It should be noted that this document is from 1996, and so some aspects may
no longer be considered best practice. 

Some other useful documents:

* [Fortran90.org best practices](https://www.fortran90.org/src/best-practices.html)
    * Community driven
* [Fortran FOSS best practices](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/Best_Practices#explicit)
    * Also community driven, fairly concise and with good examples.
* [Compact F95 Language Summary](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/~squire/fortranclass/summary.shtml)
    * Very good as a quick reference
    
## C++

A widely regarded, including by RR, style guide to follow is the 
[Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
