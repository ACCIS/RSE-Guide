## Python
Python code should conform to [Pep-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

Many IDEs provide automatic linting of code to identify violations of PEP-8.

An excellent, extensive, guide to writing good Python code can be found at
[The Hitchhikers Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/)

## MATLAB
A good style guide for Matlab, used by RR engineers, is available on the 
[Mathworks file exchange](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46056-matlab-style-guidelines-2-0).

A quick-reference version of this style guide can be found 
[here](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/e5a683fc-4a80-11e4-9553-005056977bd0/f8c4e908-a5b6-4ffb-a36a-9ee47990dfd3/images/screenshot.png)

## FORTRAN


## C++

A widely regarded, including by RR, style guide to follow is the 
[Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

It is worth noting that the style guide has been developed principally 
for Google's internal developers considering Google's needs. 
Accordingly, some recommendations are less relevant to the average developer; 
When in doubt use common sense and be consistent.
