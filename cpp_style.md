# C++

A widely regarded, including by RR, style guide to follow is the 
[Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

It is worth noting that the style guide has been developed principally 
for Google's internal developers considering Google's needs. 
Accordingly, some recommendations are less relevant to the average developer; 
When in doubt use common sense and be consistent.
