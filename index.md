# Writing good software - contents

## Core principles

1. Write code for readability, maintainability, and clarity

2. Write small functions that do _one thing_, and do that _one thing_ well

3. Don't assume your code does what you think - test it.

4. Use IDEs, debuggers, and automatic tools and documentation
